To run my code, first go to (or create a folder) called COMP30640Project, and place the scripts
inside. 

Start a server with ./server.sh

In another window, start a client with ./client.sh and enter an ID.

Then you can enter enter create_database, create_table, insert, select, exit, or shutdown.

create_database needs a database name.

create_table needs a database name, table name, and column names delimited with commas.

insert needs a database name, table name, and column data delimited with commas.

select needs a database name, table name, and can also accept column data, numbers or words, 
delimited by commas, if you wish to search for specific data.

Exit will close the client, and shutdown will close the server.

If any more detail is needed, the report goes into extensive details on how I did the project.

Thanks, and have a great holiday!
